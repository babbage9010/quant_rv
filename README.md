# quant_rv
quant_rv is a quantitative ETF trading strategy based on realized volatility, written in R. it's released under the MIT license.

the goal is to create a strategy that: 
(1) develops a signal based on market close values and trades on the next-day Open (easy to trade)
(2) makes sense logically (not based on magic)
(3) can beat market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis, and hopefully on a CAGR basis
